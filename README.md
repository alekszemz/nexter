# nexter
<br/>
<p>This is the landing page of a fictional company called <strong>"nexter"</strong> which sells luxury homes across the world. I built this project while learning the "Advanced CSS and Sass" course from Jonas Schmedtmann on the Udemy platform. The goal of this project was to use as many CSS grid layouts as possible.</p>
<p>One of the main features of this website is the use of CSS grid layout to create a visually appealing and responsive design. Through the use of grid templates, rows, and columns, the website is able to showcase the various luxury homes offered by the company in a clean and organized manner.</p>
<p>Additionally, the website also makes use of advanced CSS techniques such as CSS grid and flexbox for responsive design, CSS variables for efficient styling, and CSS animations for a dynamic user experience.</p>
