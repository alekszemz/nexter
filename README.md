# nexter
This is the landing page of a fictional company called "nexter" which sells luxury home across the world. I built this project when learning "Advanced CSS and Sass" course from Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy platform. The goal of this project is basically to use as many css grids layouts here as possible.
